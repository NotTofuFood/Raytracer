# A C++ Raytracer by Aiden Thakurdial

**FEATURES**

* A C++ Raytracer with SFML for graphics rendering; I did not utilise anything from SFML other than stuff for displaying graphics.
* My own Vector3 class stored in a header file. (see vec3.h)
* Diffuse lighting
* Only object as of right now is a sphere, but that is soon to change.
* Custom resolution. (see defines in main.cpp)
